 iPhone X, iPad, two makes of laptop computer and one desktop this covered Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari. 

## Mobile Friendly Test

- Passed the Google mobile friendly test.

## User Story Testing Outcomes

- User 1: "I am wanting to learn the flags of the world to improve my geographical knowledge."

The game is designed in a way to show the different flags to the user as well as informing them of the answers when they do not know the answer, 
this will improve their knowledge of the flags of the world.

- User 2: "As a visiting user I would like to see the number of questions available for me to answer"

The flag count displays the amount of flags and will increment after every question informing the user how many questions are available to answer.

- User 3: "As a visiting user I would like to be able to reset the game when I reach the end."

The reset button will allow the user to reset the game at any point and the restart button on the end modal will reset the game at the end.

## Fixed Bugs
- Encountered some problems with centering the Bootstrap modal text and button. Was resolved using the bootstrap class `d block` and the CSS `text-align: center`.  
Credit: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50041065/bootstrap-4-modal-center-content).
- The jquery selector `:contains` wouldn't implement with a variable, found the solution was to escape the double quotes with single quotes.  
Credit: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2191419/jquery-contains-with-a-variable-syntax).
- Encountered problems with the on click event listener, when the user clicked multiple times on the answer buttons the flag count and score would increment
 and next flag would change with every click before the next question could render. I found the solution was to disable the answer buttons after they were clicked and enable 
 them again once the next question had rendered, using `$(".answer-button").attr("disabled", true);` and  `$(".answer-button").attr("disabled", false);`
- On the first attempt the HTML validator failed as there was an unnecessary type attribute on the link to the index.js page, and an obselete attribute 
on the start modal, which was copied across form the Bootstrap library for the modal.  
![Image](assets/images/readme-images/failed-html-validator.png)
- When testing I came across the issue that if the user clicked outside of the end modal it would disappear, leaving them with a blank centre container 
and the buttons still clickable and the flag count and score would also increase when the buttons were clicked. To resolve this issue is added the HTML 
` data-keyboard="false" data-backdrop="static"` to the end modal to prevent it disappearing when clicking anywhere but the "Restart" button.

## Outstanding Bugs

- CSS validator had 2 errors both were from the Bootstraps CDN so were unable to be resolved.
